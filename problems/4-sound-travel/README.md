# 4.  Sound Travel

If a really loud sound is made on earth, how long would it take for it to be heard on Mars?  Using your distance formula from #3 and the speed of sound, create a function that returns how long (in hours) it would take for a sound to travel between two planets.  The result should be rounded to the nearest hour.

**Data**

* Use your function from #3 to calculate distance between two planets
* Speed of sound - 761.207051 miles per hour
